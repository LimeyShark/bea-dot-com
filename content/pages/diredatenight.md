## Dire Date Night demo is out now!

*You're 15 minutes late to a blind date with a girl that you have absolutely no chemistry with.  Also she's secretly a werewolf.  Navigate awkward conversations and touchy subjects with your stone-faced date, and if you're lucky you might be able to salvage the night*

Visit the itch.io [page](https://limeyshark.itch.io/dire-date-night) to play!

Created using [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/). All programming and art by me, all dialogue written with the help of my girlfriend.
